# Welcome to Crazy Town, USA

>No one should pretend that Trump will be a normal president. No one should forget the bigotry and racism of his campaign, the naked appeals to white grievance, the stigmatizing of Mexicans and Muslims. No one should forget the jaw-dropping ignorance he showed about government policy both foreign and domestic. No one should forget the vile misogyny. No one should forget the mendacity, the vulgarity, the ugliness, the insanity. None of this should ever be normalized in our politics.

The current state of politics in the U.S. is beyond the pale. This repository is a place to collect the evidence. I'm not talking about garden-variety political scummery here — carefully parsed lies, influence peddling, or ideology you disagree with — I'm talking about the next-level crazy stuff that makes you shake your head and say, "Is this really happening?" I'm talking about things like birther conspriacy theories, mocking a disabled reporter, or calling your opponents juvenile names.  

I'm mostly just doing this for my personal reference (and sanity) to remind myself that ***none of this should ever be normalized in our politics***. But I'm also making it publicly available in the hope that others find this compilation and reminder useful.  

#### Ground Rules

1. Stories must be based on indisputable facts.
1. Stories must be cited and from credible sources (preferably more than one).
1. Stories must be about a candidate for public office or an elected official (federal only); pre-candidacy shenanigans of a private citizen do not count.
1. Story summaries must hew closely to the facts without argument or editorializing. The facts alone should speak for themselves. 

#### Dissenting Opinions?

No trolls. If you want to have a respectful discussion, I'm open to being convivnced that (1) something was misreported or unfairly misrepresented in the press; or (2) something is not actually so outrageous compared to normal politics. Feel free to open an issue or pull request to discuss. But keep it classy; ad hominem attacks will immediately result in your being blocked and/or locked. And if you don't convince me, it's my repo, so I get to close the issues the way I want. But you can always fork your own competing reality. :smile:
